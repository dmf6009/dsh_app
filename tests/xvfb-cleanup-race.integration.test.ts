/**
 * Adversarial cleanup-race integration test (review requirement).
 *
 * Proves the token-based compare-and-release cleanup is race-free against a
 * CONCURRENT run B that wins the same display during run A's cleanup window:
 *
 *  - A and B use the SAME production lockDir (/tmp) and the SAME explicit
 *    display (DSH_XVFB_DISPLAY), so they truly compete for one lockfile — not
 *    isolated per-run lockDirs.
 *  - A is driven into cleanup fast (short timeout) and PAUSED mid-cleanup
 *    (DSH_CLEANUP_BARRIER) AFTER its Xvfb is killed but BEFORE its socket
 *    unlink / lock release. This is exactly the window the review flagged.
 *  - While A is paused, B tries the same explicit display: it must FAIL CLOSED
 *    (A still owns the lock with its token; B does NOT clobber A).
 *  - After A's barrier is released, A finishes cleanup (socket unlink + lock
 *    release, compare-and-release). A LATE/DUPLICATE cleanup by A (token no
 *    longer matches) must NOT delete B's later-acquired lock/socket.
 *  - Then B can claim the now-freed display and start its Xvfb, whose server
 *    and socket remain usable.
 *
 * Skips cleanly when Xvfb / the built renderer / Electron are unavailable.
 * Reliable cleanup: every started launcher + Xvfb is reaped in afterEach.
